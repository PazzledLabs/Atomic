Atomic is a simple clone of the popular puzzle game (KAtomic) that is part of the KDE applications. It employs simplistic two-dimensional view of a molecule. The Elements that make up the molecule are disassembled into separate atoms and scattered around the play field. The player is expected to reassemble, thus completing current level and moving up to the next one.

The game is very addictive puzzle and a good brain teaser which can easily hijack you for long hours. An intelligent strategy is to concentrate and think before every move.

If you are bored and looking for a challenging puzzle then you have come to the right place. Go ahead, install and enjoy the game as much as we do at Pazzled Labs. Please rate us at Google Play if you like us.

Game Rules:
----------
- Game pieces can only move in one direction at a time.
- Once an atom begins moving it will not stop until it meets either a wall or another piece.


Tips and Tricks:
---------------
- Always review the complete molecule by clicking the atomic icon at the bottom right before making any moves.
- Next, study the play field and plan your moves
- Think through your every move and try to visualize the trajectory piece will follow once a directional arrow is clicked.
